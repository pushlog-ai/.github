## 🎯 What is PushLog?

**PushLog** is a web-based SaaS platform that turns every code push into a clear, AI-summarized update in Slack. Connect your GitHub repos and Slack channels once — then get smart notifications automatically. Add **Sentry** and you get error spikes, regressions, and deploy-related incidents in the same place. No scripts to run, no servers to host. Just [pushlog.ai](https://pushlog.ai) in your browser.

> 💡 **TL;DR:** Push code → PushLog summarizes it with AI → Your team gets a readable Slack message. Optional: Sentry incidents show up there too.

## 🚨 Incident alerts (Sentry)

PushLog can receive events from **Sentry** and show them as incident notifications alongside your push activity.

- **Quick setup:** Create a Sentry Internal Integration with webhook URL  
  `https://pushlog.ai/api/webhooks/sentry`  
  Add an Alert Rule, and you’re done.
- **Full guide:** [Sentry Setup →](docs/SENTRY_SETUP.md)

## 📡 Server agent (pushlog-agent)

Besides Sentry, you can stream **runtime errors** from your own servers using **pushlog-agent**: a small Go binary that runs on Linux, watches log files or stderr, and sends events to PushLog. Create an agent in **Settings → Agents**, get a token, then install and run the agent on your hosts.

- **Docs:** [PushLog Agent (Go) →](docs/PUSHLOG_AGENT_GO.md) — install, config, systemd, and usage
- **Where:** Agent code lives in the `agent/` directory in this repo
